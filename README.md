Some old repository

Hello everyone!

My name is Alex, I am twenty years old, and I like running and combat sports like kickboxing.  I love video games and computers, my favorite game is Dark Souls.  I am just getting into computer science and have just finished my first year of college under the computer science major.  I hope to gain more experience and learn new things through GitHub!
